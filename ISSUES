1. Cannnot process file correctly when artist tag contains "ft"

2. Does not handle artist with somewhat varying names e.g
	i) Bone thugs n harmony
	ii) Bone thugs n' harmony
	iii) Bone thugs-N-harmony

3. Application needs to log files which have no been classified due to errors.

4. There is no application configuration system. Settings such as default music folder need to be able
to be set by the user

5. Need to monitor filesystem, as soon as I get pyinotify

6. We need rhythmbox plugin to monitor "similar musicians", basically -- it should be in charge of
maintance of id2v1 tags
