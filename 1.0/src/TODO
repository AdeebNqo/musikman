1. Need to test of added file is a music file before trying to classify it
2. remove .gitignore file here and place it in root directory
3. Need better error handling -- errors kill the application completely [IN PROGRESS]
4. Remove whitespace from both artist and album field [Done]
5. Need to sanitize path to artist and album, may contain '/' thus creating extra folder
6. Watching a directory must be recursive
